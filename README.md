# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I found the particle system in p5.js. It can create dynamic effects similar to pixelation by manipulating the properties and positions of particles. This technique helps me to add animation to the pixelated effect of an image. 
In this technique, the image is split into multiple particles. Each particle can be moved according to its brightness and position. By gradually adjusting the transparency, color, or speed of each particle, the image can be made to appear as a one-pixel dynamic effect.
